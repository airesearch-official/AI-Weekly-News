## 🚀 Wrap Up
This week was a testament to how fast AI is moving from research to production. With Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex, agentic workflows are becoming the new standard. Real-time video generation and studio-grade music are now accessible to everyone.
- **Agentic coding is here**: New models are no longer just writing code; they are managing entire codebases independently.
- **Multimodal is the default**: From OCR to music and interactive worlds, AI is now truly omni-modal.
- **Efficiency meets power**: Sparse MoE architectures like Step 3.5 Flash are proving that we can have frontier intelligence with much lower compute costs.
